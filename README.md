Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

answer.
Software engineering is wereby computer programs are build in an organized way. it contains planning, creating, testing, and maintaining softwares to ensure they work well and meets user needs. It's important because it ensures that apps runs smoothly with having problems and makes programs to improve over time.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

answer.
Software engineering was created in 1968 before 1968 the software development was not organized then in 1968 the engineering principle was implemented which was planning,testing, and documenting and thing started to be better.

OOP was introduced in 1980 which contains concepts like classes,object,inheritance, and encapsulation.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

answer.
planning- Dicide what the software should do, how long it will take and what resource are needed

Requirement Analysis- Gather information about what users need and document all the features.

Design- planning how the software should look like including databases and system structure.

Implimantation- Coding the designed software to come to life.

Testing- checking if the system designed works as expected and it doesnt have errors and bugs.

Deployment- Making the software to be available to user to use.

Mantainance- Making sure the software is updated, issues are fixed, and over time it is improved

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

answer.
waterfall- follows the step-by-step plan, hard to change once started, it allows feedback only when everything is done and tesing is done after coding is complete.

Building of a Hospital system
This system must have a strict ruels,security and clear plan. 


Agile Methodology- Works in small, flexible cycles, easy to adjust anytime, allows feedbacks anytime, testing is done everytime and anytime during development

Creating a social media app
This system always require users feedback so that the system will improve.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

answer.
software developer- build and maintain software application. Their responsibility are to  Write code, fixing errors and improving software perfomance and keeping it updated.

Quality Assurance Engineer- Makes sure that the software work well. Their responsibility are test for bugs and problems, report issues and help developers fix the, ensure software meets users need and improving testing processes.

Project Manager- Oversee the whole project and make sure that it is completed in time. Their responsibility are Plan task, budget and deadlines, tracks the progress of the project and solves problems, make sure the software meets business goals


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

answer.
IDE is a tool used for helping developers write,test, and fix code in one place. It is importand as it helps with debugging, It organizes code. e.g Visual Studio

VCS Helps track changes to code and manange multiple version over time. It is important because it makes team work together, tracks changes, stores all your codes safely.e.g git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Finding and fixing bugs and it can be overcomed by using a debugger tool (IDE)

Delaying of projects due to unexpected ploblems found during the deadlines and it can be overcomed by using Agile methodologies and prioritizing projects.

Miscommunication among team members and it can be overcomed by making sure you communicate with your team members often using tools like slack, teams, zoom etc,and making sure that everyne understands the project goals fromstart


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing- testing individual parts of the software to make sure they work. it is important as it helps with finding bugs early and speeds up development.

Integration Testing- testing how different parts of the software work together. It is important because it ensures that modules interact correctly

System testing- testing the whole system to make sure everything works together. It is important beacuse its validates the entire software and checks that it meets requirements.

Acceptance testing- testing to see if the software meets the user's needs.It is important because it comfirms the software is ready for rease


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
make AI more affective,accurate, and user-friendly. It is important because it improves accuracy, saves time,reduce confusions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Tell me about the climate. Explain the main causes of climate change and how they affect global remperatures

It specifies the causes of climate change and thier impacton global temperatures.
